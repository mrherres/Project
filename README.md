**How to play**

*Pre-game*

Begin by submitting your name on the landing page, this will send you to the pre-game page, which will show you who your opponent is, and if they are ready to start the game. This page will also contain a short description of the game rules and two buttons. The first button is used to change if a player is ready to start or unready, if all players have chosen to ready up the game will start. The second button resets the players and sends the players back to the landing page.


*The game*

When the game starts, all players will be sent through to the actual game page. This center of the page is taken up by the game board. The current players, their color and their amount of wins will be displayed in a table to the left of the board as well as the dice. Lastly the page contains a reset game button to the right of the board. This button will reset everything and send the players back to the landing page so they can start a whole new game.

Roll the dice by clicking it. You can only see the dice when it's your turn. After rolling the dice, select the pawn you would like to move. If you have no pawns on the board, you need to roll six first to get a pawn on the board. You win the game when all four of your pawns have reached the finish.
